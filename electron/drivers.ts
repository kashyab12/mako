/**
 * Continue a thread with its own harness.
 *
 * The other half of continuation: "Continue here" hands a conversation to
 * this app's agent, and this hands the user's next message back to the CLI
 * that owns the session — Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, Grok — headlessly, in
 * the thread's working directory.
 *
 * There is deliberately no stream parsing here. Every one of these CLIs
 * writes its native session store as it works, the catalog is already
 * watching those stores, and the open viewer is already tailing the file —
 * so the transcript arrives through the same path it would if the user had
 * run the CLI in a terminal. The driver's whole job is to start the process,
 * say whether it is running, and carry the exit status. That is what keeps a
 * new harness's driver at five lines instead of five hundred.
 *
 * Every CLI runs with its own auto-approval flag. That is what continuing a
 * session non-interactively *is* — there is no one at the prompt to approve
 * tool calls — and it matches how these agents are run on this machine. The
 * arguments are one table below, on purpose: the security posture of this
 * file should be readable in ten seconds.
