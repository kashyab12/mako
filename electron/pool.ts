/**
 * The open tabs.
 *
 * Mako used to hold exactly one agent, and starting another tore the first one
 * down — so "branch this conversation and try the other answer" meant losing
 * the answer you already had. This holds several at once. Each tab is a whole
 * `AgentHost`: its own runtime, its own working directory, its own git root.
 * They stream concurrently; only the foreground one sends its transcript over
 * the wire.
 *
 * Commands from the UI always address the tab you are looking at, because that
 * is the only one with a composer in front of it. The pool's own surface is
 * therefore small: open, close, activate, and fork-into-a-new-tab.
