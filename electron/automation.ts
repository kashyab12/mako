/**
 * A way to drive the window without touching the mouse.
 *
 * Verifying UI by synthesising clicks at screen coordinates works, but it
 * takes over the machine while it runs — the pointer moves, focus changes, and
 * whoever is using the computer is locked out for the duration. That is an
 * unacceptable way to check a button, and it is also fragile: it depends on
 * window position, on which app is frontmost, and on Chromium receiving a
 * click event that carries the right click-count field.
 *
 * This is the honest version. A loopback endpoint evaluates an expression in
 * the renderer and returns the result, so a check reads
 * `button.click()` / `document.querySelectorAll(...).length` instead of
 * "move to 881,541 and hope". Screenshots still work on a background window,
 * so the whole thing runs while the machine is in use.
 *
 * **Off unless asked for.** It requires a development build *and*
 * `MAKO_AUTOMATION=<port>` in the environment, and it binds to 127.0.0.1 only.
 * An endpoint that runs arbitrary code in the window is not something to leave
 * lying around, so it exists only when someone has explicitly turned it on for
 * this launch.
