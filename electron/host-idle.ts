 * test run or one review, and the launcher that started it is usually the
 * only thing that knows it is there. Three of them were found idling for two
 * days, each rescanning the session catalog and rewriting its cache every
 * minute for no reader.
 *
 * Idle means: no client attached, no launcher lease, no lifecycle work, no
 * shutdown already in progress. Only a continuous idle span longer than the
 * window counts; any activity restarts it. The decision to stop is taken once.
