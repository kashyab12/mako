/**
 * What is where, and what the keys do.
 *
 * The alternative — a scripted tour with coach marks — was rejected on
 * purpose. A tour arrives before you have a reason to care, blocks the thing
 * it is describing, and is dismissed once and never seen again, which means
 * the one moment it could help (three weeks in, wondering what a panel is) is
 * the moment it is gone.
 *
 * This is the opposite: available whenever, on one key, showing everything at
 * once. The shortcut list is **generated from the command registry**, so it
 * cannot drift from what the app actually does — including anything a plugin
 * has registered. A hand-maintained list of keys is wrong within a month.
