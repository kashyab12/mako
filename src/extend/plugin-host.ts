/**
 * The plugin host.
 *
 * Mako is meant to be modifiable by the agent running inside it, and the
 * obvious way to do that — edit the source and let the bundler hot-replace it —
 * only works in development. A shipped app has no source tree and no dev
 * server, so that path offers the user a change they could never see.
 *
 * This is the path that works in both. A plugin is one `.tsx` file. It is
 * transpiled in-process, evaluated as a module, and calls the same registration
 * API that everything Mako ships already uses. Because those registries are
 * versioned and React reads them through `useSyncExternalStore`, a registration
 * repaints the surfaces that consume it **immediately** — no reload, no lost
 * session, no lost scroll position, in a packaged build exactly as in a dev
 * one.
 *
 * Three deliberate limits:
 *
 *   * No bundler. A plugin cannot `import` from npm; everything it may touch is
 *     handed to it as `mako`. That keeps the runtime at about a megabyte
 *     instead of fifteen, and keeps the surface something a person can read.
 *   * No type checking. Sucrase strips types rather than verifying them, which
 *     is the right trade for something re-evaluated on every save.
 *   * Every registration is disposable, and reloading a plugin disposes the
 *     previous one first. That is what makes editing a plugin feel like editing
 *     a component rather than like restarting a service.
