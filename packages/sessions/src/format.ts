 * The canonical shape of a coding-agent conversation.

 * translate into, and it is deliberately smaller than any of them: it keeps
 * exactly what is needed to *show* a conversation anywhere and to *continue*
 * it anywhere, and it always keeps a pointer back to the native file, which
 * remains the source of truth for anything provider-specific.
 *
 * Lossy on purpose. A canonical format that tries to round-trip every
 * provider's private fields becomes a union of all of them — which is not a
 * format, it is a pile. Fidelity lives in the native store; portability lives
 * here.
