# Mako

Mako is a meta-harness. Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Grok, Devin, and OpenCode
are peer providers with provider-owned control and observation transports. No provider
is privileged in public types, bridge names, UI language, continuation, or
session handling.

Mako has no embedded coding-agent runtime. `electron/host.ts` owns only the
workspace and git boundary; every coding agent runs through a provider-owned
process. Never expose Pi as a provider, bridge, IPC namespace, message type,
UI label, or "native" path.

`ignore/` is reference-only and gitignored: DeepSeek Harness, Pierre, T3 Code,
ORCA, Codex, Zed, Superset, OpenCode, macOS Harness, CUA, and Browser Use.
Study material, never imported or edited.

Prior art worth knowing: ORCA's sidebar flattens groups into a `header | item`
row list with a user-selectable group-by, which is what `rail-rows.ts` follows.
Codex's "backtrack" (Esc-Esc) navigates your past prompts to fork from one,
which is what the turn navigator and the History panel are for.

## Layers

One direction of knowledge, no exceptions:

1. **Host** (`electron/`) owns the agent runtime and git. It speaks one wire
   contract, `electron/shared.ts`, and nothing else crosses the boundary.
2. **State** (`src/state/`) is React-free. `store.ts` is the observable;
   `session.ts` applies host events and owns every mutation the UI can make.
3. **Components** (`src/components/`) are presentation. They read through
   selectors and call domain actions in `src/state/`. Components and desk code
   never import `src/lib/bridge.ts`; ESLint enforces that boundary.

## Provider composition

A provider is installed once from `electron/providers/<id>/index.ts`. That
module contributes independent capabilities to `providerHost`: metadata and
model discovery, native and ACP execution, native session emission, accounts,
MCP discovery/writes, and skill roots.
Consumers query those registries; they never maintain another list of provider
ids or branch on all known providers. Provider-specific wire syntax and paths
belong under that provider's directory. A new provider adds one module to
`electron/providers/index.ts`; it does not add switches to shared consumers.

`@mako/sessions` remains the pure native-store layer. Its `SessionProvider`
contract owns discovery, translation, and following without importing Electron
or any provider host capability.

Exact external activity is also provider-owned. A process probe returns a typed
`available` or `unavailable` snapshot keyed by native session ID or canonical
store path; an error is never interpreted as zero active sessions. The activity
engine polls each provider independently, prevents overlap, bounds stale data,
and emits narrow activity events instead of resending or re-sorting the catalog.

## The hot path

Token streaming must never re-send the session. The host emits `stream` with
only the in-flight message; `messages`, `tree`, and `git` go out only when they
actually change, and every burst is coalesced into one flush per frame. On the
renderer side components subscribe through selectors, so a token wakes the one
turn rendering it — not the rail, the stage strip, or the titlebar's readings.

Three rules hold this together, and each has a specific failure it prevents:

- **Select the narrowest slice.** `useSession((s) => s.meta)` in the transcript
  re-renders the whole list whenever a token count moves. Take `s.meta?.cwd`.
- **Reconcile message identity** (`src/lib/reconcile.ts`). The host rebuilds
  the entire message array whenever a tool returns, so every object arrives
  new; without reconciliation one tool result re-parses the markdown of every
  turn in the session.
- **Long lists are virtualized, long content uses `content-visibility`.** The
  rail is windowed with `@tanstack/react-virtual`; transcript turns and
  surface-panel rows carry `.contain-turn` so offscreen work is skipped
  without the fragility of windowing variable-height streaming content.

The rail bounds mounted rows through folder pagination and an explicit search
result cap; it never renders the full catalog. Components that genuinely use
`useVirtualizer` stay isolated because the React Compiler cannot memoize them.

Native JSONL files can contain multi-gigabyte tool output. Readers must cap one
record before retaining it, skip into a tail from the next newline, and collect
bounded chunks before one final concatenation. Never carry `Buffer.concat`
through a loop. Catalog scans use bounded concurrency, and provider metadata
queries select only the native session IDs being peeked rather than hydrating a
whole provider database.

## The built-in runtime's session tree is not a tree

It is a parent-linked chain: every entry is a child of the previous one, so
nesting depth grows once per *entry*, not once per branch. A real session is
345 entries nested 334 deep, with 7 user turns and 45 model/thinking changes.

This has bitten twice. Rendered as written it is a staircase that runs off the
right edge. **Serialized as written it exceeds Electron's contextBridge clone
depth of 1000** and the window dies with a recursion error. The wire format is
therefore a flat `TreeNode[]` carrying `parentId` and `childIds`; never
reintroduce nesting.

`src/lib/thread.ts` is the translation: it collects user turns from the whole
tree, folds settings into the turn they applied to, and expresses real branch
points as alternate "takes" rather than as indentation. Turns are gathered from
the entire tree and not just the live path, because navigating away leaves
earlier turns on an abandoned branch and those are exactly the ones worth
rewinding to — sessions exist whose live path contains no messages at all.

## Extending the desk

Four registries, all in `src/extend/`. Everything the desk itself ships is
registered through them, so nothing built-in is privileged:

```ts
registerCommand({ id, title, section, keys: "mod+j", run })  // palette + keyboard
registerSlot("my-badge", "composer.controls", Component)      // UI seams
registerToolView("bash", { summary, body, icon })             // transcript rows
registerSurface({ id, label, icon, render, minWidth })        // stage companions
```

The stage's surfaces — Changes, Context, History, Files, Terminal —
are all registered through `registerSurface` on exactly the same footing as
anything a plugin would add. One reading surface opens as the right sidebar at
a fixed, draggable width; the independent Terminal dock can remain open below it
at a fixed, draggable height. Neither uses percentage splits. The central workbench
stays mounted under a covering sidebar so transcripts and file tabs keep their state.

Files loaded from the user-data extensions directory are **trusted local UI
extensions**, not sandboxed host plugins. They can read and mutate renderer
state, are bounded by file/contribution limits, and cannot register host
providers. Do not describe them as isolated or safe for third-party code.

Slots are declared in `SlotMap` (`src/extend/slots.ts`) — that table is the
contract for what may render where and with which props. Adding a seam means
adding a key there. Built-in registrations live in `src/desk/builtins.tsx` and
`src/desk/use-desk-commands.ts`.

A command with a `keys` field is automatically live in the palette, in the
keyboard layer, and in any menu that reads the registry. Never add a bare
`keydown` listener for a shortcut.

## The transcript is grouped by exchange

Built-in sessions, native-store threads, and live ACP/app-server sessions all
project into `ChatMessage` and render through `conversation-timeline.tsx`.
Provider-specific headers, permissions, and modes may wrap that timeline; they
must not introduce another transcript renderer.

`src/lib/exchanges.ts` folds messages into one question plus everything the
agent did to answer it. Two things depend on that grouping and both were wrong
before it existed: **copy belongs to the whole answer**, not to each fragment
of a long reply, and the turn navigator needs something meaningful to jump
between. The prompt gets its own surface so it is unmistakably the user's.

## Never lose a paragraph

A draft is the one thing in the desk the user made and cannot get back. Every
other state — the diff, the tree, the token count — is recoverable by asking
again. So the composer clears optimistically, because typing the next thing
should be instant, and `drafts` in `composer.tsx` keeps the text per session so
switching tabs mid-sentence costs nothing.

Restoring a refused send is where this gets subtle, and the trap is timing.
`session.prompt()` does not resolve when the prompt is *accepted*; it awaits
`_runAgentPrompt` and the whole `continue()` loop, so an awaited `send` settles
minutes later, when the answer is done. Restoring a draft on that promise
overwrites the paragraph the user has since typed — losing work in the name of
saving it — and can paint it into whatever session is on screen by then.
Rejection is a *preflight* fact (no model, no key), so read it from the
built-in runtime's `PromptOptions.preflightResult` and settle in one tick, while the composer is
still provably empty. Anything that repaints the textarea later must first
check that the draft is still empty and the session has not changed; otherwise
leave the text in `drafts` and say so.

The same rule covers the quieter losses: `buildPrompt` silently omits an
attachment that is still `pending`, so sending mid-staging drops a file with no
notice, and `clear()` revokes preview URLs — which is why detaching for a
possible restore is separate from discarding for good.

## MCP

Mako owns a redacted, provider-neutral MCP registry. Use the current
`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` and its latest negotiated protocol (currently
2025-11-25); do not hand-roll legacy SSE framing. Streamable HTTP is the remote
transport, stdio is the local transport, and tool annotations must accurately
state read-only, destructive, idempotent, and open-world behavior. Provider
OAuth remains provider-owned. Never send secret values over IPC, logs, tests,
or registry snapshots.

## Remote control plane

`@mako/relay` is the pure provider-neutral protocol and headless worker core.
It owns remote jobs, canonical events, event cursors, controls, the worker loop,
and the storage contract. It must not import Electron, Next, Azure, Slack, or a
provider implementation. Desktop and headless hosts supply an executor and
transport; gateways register backend delivery adapters.

Relay workers authenticate with short-lived tenant/device tokens. The shared
MCP token is registration bootstrap only unless an operator explicitly enables
the temporary legacy migration flag. Keep event persistence idempotent, validate
batch and lease ownership before writes, reconcile queue/table partial failures,
and stream attachment bodies through measured limits rather than buffering them.

## Zero lint debt

Every source change must leave both ESLint and Oxlint clean. Run `npm run lint`
before handoff; `npm run lint:anti-slop` must report zero warnings and zero
errors. Do not disable, downgrade, or bypass anti-slop rules. A narrowly scoped
exception is allowed only when the owning external API makes a typed boundary
impossible, and it must include a precise safety invariant plus a regression
test. Existing debt is never a reason to add new debt.

## Git

`ChangesPanel` stages, commits, and pushes. Commit drafting uses the host-only
AI SDK connections in `utility-models.ts`, configured in Settings > Commit
messages, never a coding-agent session. API keys are encrypted through Electron
safeStorage in the isolated profile; no key is returned in a settings snapshot.
Changing a custom endpoint requires re-entering its key. Model calls, retries,
parallelism, and diff bytes are bounded. Oversized and sensitive-path omissions
are reported alongside the draft; filename filtering is not a general secret scanner.
`commit-drafts.ts` keeps per-workspace edits and offers late results as suggestions
rather than overwriting a message. `npm run test:commit-generation` exercises real
Git repositories, AI SDK calls, context recovery, cancellation, and encrypted storage.
`node scripts/test-commit-ui.mjs <isolated-dev-url>` runs the real-host connection
and drafting flow with trusted UI input and a local model endpoint. It requires
an isolated host profile with no existing model connections and prints screenshots.
It also checks commit-footer geometry and the computed Shadow DOM colors of sidebar
diffs, center diffs, and source files across light, dark, and system-theme changes.
Pierre's `diffs-container` inherits Mako's color scheme and token bindings from
`src/index.css`; component-level dark/light overrides are unnecessary.

Commit model names and limits come from models.dev or an explicit provider API
lookup, not a version list in the renderer. Only the public catalog is cached;
account lists stay scoped to the submitted or saved key and endpoint. Discovery
bounds response bytes, pages, and rows, and never sends keys to models.dev.
`npx tsx scripts/test-utility-model-catalog.ts --live` checks the current public
catalogs without credentials. The UI check covers current model selection, custom
IDs, keyboard navigation, and ignoring responses after credentials change.

Two things to preserve: a repository with **no commits has no HEAD**, so
`diff HEAD` fails in exactly the state where a first commit message is most
wanted — `gitPatch` falls back to the index and then to a file listing. And
push publishes work off the machine, so it stays a separately-labelled
deliberate action and never rides along with a commit.

## Design rules

- Tokens live in `src/index.css` and nowhere else. No literal colors in
  components. Chrome (`--shell`) carries no shadow, ever. Structural workspace
  panes tile edge-to-edge with square edges and 1px dividers; rounded `.card`
  surfaces are reserved for content within a pane. Real shadows exist only on
  floating surfaces (`.overlay-panel`: menus, palette, dialogs).
- **The ramp is warm ember neutrals — red-shifted near-blacks, warm
  off-white text — and stays that quiet.** Ember (`--ember`) is punctuation,
  not brand: the live/working dot, the composer caret, at most one badge.
  Never on links, borders, focus, selection, hover fills, icons at rest, or
  any fill larger than a badge; if two ember moments are visible in one
  pane, one is wrong. Selection and hover are tints of the text colour
  (`--fill-hover` / `--fill-selected`), never the accent. Beyond ember, hue
  appears only where it carries meaning: diff add/remove, error, warning.
- **Three UI type sizes only** — `text-label` (11), `text-ui` (13),
  `text-title` (15) — plus prose (14) and code (12). Weights come off
  Geist's variable axis as 440/530/640 through the standard `font-normal`/
  `font-medium`/`font-semibold` classes. No literal `text-[Npx]` in
  components; eslint enforces both this and the raw-hue ban.
- **No uppercase micro-labels.** Section labels are sentence case with no
  letterspacing. Uppercase + tracking at 10px is the most recognisable tell of
  a generated interface and it costs legibility for nothing.
- **Every number carries its noun.** A bare `33%` next to a bare `$6.62` is
  decoration that looks like information. Write `context 141K/400K` and
  `$6.62 spent`.
- Geist for UI, the platform monospace for code. Do not ship a code webfont.
- Two curves: `--ease-out` for everything that arrives, `--ease-swift` for
  everything that leaves — exits faster than entrances. Entrances stay under
  250ms and nothing animates from `scale(0)`. Anything triggered by keyboard
  many times a day (the palette) does not animate at all.
- Pressable surfaces carry the `pressable` class.

## Product surface

Provider sessions, the built-in runtime's session tree, and the current git
diff. No worktree manager. There is no status bar: the always-on facts live
in the titlebar's right cluster, and the context/cost readings sit beside
the composer, next to the send they price. The rail is the vertical thread
list; horizontal tabs inside the central workbench hold the agent session,
files, and diffs for that thread, never more sessions.

## Working on the UI

`npm run dev` (or `npm run web`) starts the real Electron host behind a local web
UI. Open the URL printed by Vite without `?mock`. Use real native threads,
provider settings, git state, and host events for normal UI verification.
Opening and inspecting threads does not start an agent; sending a prompt does.
`npm run desktop` uses the same host through Electron preload.

`npm run dev:fixtures` plus `?mock` is an explicit fixture mode for deterministic
edge cases, not the default UI verification path. Changes to host handler
arguments require `npm run generate:host-inputs`; `npm run test:web` checks drift
and rejects invalid requests before dispatch. The web gateway stays loopback-only
and same-origin; the host endpoint is a private local socket.

Dev launches default to manual renderer updates. Reload UI loads current renderer
code without restarting provider processes; Open shared-host preview opens a separate
preview with independently persisted drafts. Host changes still require an explicit
Restart Mako. `npm run dev:hot` opts into automatic hot updates. The launcher uses a
checkout-specific profile by default; `MAKO_PROFILE` selects another isolated profile.
Desktop dev also exposes the same-origin web UI and wears a Dev Dock badge.

`npm run test:workspace-ui` exercises production components with isolated fixtures
and trusted CDP input, retaining screenshots in its printed temporary directory.
`node scripts/test-composer-ui.mjs <dev-url>` checks attachment editing with trusted
input, then compares real provider model controls with discovery without sending a
prompt. `npx tsx scripts/check-harness-models.ts --live` requires fresh defaults
from every registered provider; a timeout or missing value fails the check.
`npm run test:tuning` rebuilds the shared session library and checks discovery
lifecycle failures, defaults, and probe cleanup.
`npx tsx scripts/test-devin-settings.ts --live` repeats native discovery and checks
for retained probe sessions;
`npx tsx scripts/test-opencode-settings.ts --live` compares discovery with a fresh
ACP session and deletes that verification session. Neither sends an agent prompt.
`npm run test:dev-updates` checks deferred update delivery. After building Electron,
`node scripts/test-provider-e2e.mjs <provider> --steer --continuation` checks real
mid-turn delivery, idle replies, queueing, native identity, and retained context.
The installed OpenCode v2 ACP server rejects concurrent prompts. Its free
`opencode/muse-spark-1.3-contributor-free` model passes normal replies and queueing;
verify it with `--continuation`, not by advertising unsupported steering.

Normal desktop Quit backgrounds the app while owned work is active. Activation
reopens its windows without replacing the provider process. Force Quit and system
shutdown are different: journals recover history, not a running process. Host
restart and update installation wait for active work to finish. The `--background`
launch switch keeps test windows hidden until explicitly activated.
`npm run test:desktop-continuity` exercises actual Mako with an installed Devin
process through Quit/reopen, a retained question, and a second native window.

Permission modes are saved only after provider acknowledgement, separately for
each provider. New sessions apply that mode before their first prompt. Execution
preferences sync between windows; draft text and preview layout remain separate.
Each renderer and web document owns its workspace pool and git target, selected
through async request context. Provider conversations remain shared. A preview
must never change another window's cwd, file target, or active workspace tab.
The rail's Projects view keeps active sessions under their project; Recent is a
bounded chronological list. Never gate provider names or the rail on model discovery.

Native session ownership is provider plus native session ID, not a catalog path.
Account roots can expose one Claude session through multiple paths. Capture and
reply must reuse that owner; external activity must never silently turn a reply
into a handoff. `scripts/test-session-identity.ts` covers these aliases.

Installed Mako and an isolated dev build are separate hosts. Their live journals
are not synchronized. Shared-host preview windows receive the same conversation
events; `test:desktop-continuity` verifies replies and permission answers in both
directions. Never merge active journals to simulate shared ownership.

An interrupted request already represented in the transcript needs only a stopped
marker on its exchange. Recovery details retain failed, uncertain, and otherwise
unrepresented input without repeating it in a permanent panel. An auxiliary ACP
steering cancellation cannot override a successful turn; explicit Stop remains distinct.
The main activity indicator uses the tuned 64px thinking-orbs states. Running
project headers and rows use the separately tuned 20px preset; terminal states
remain static. Motion must stop offscreen and under reduced motion. Keyboard jump
hints cover the provider glyph, never the status indicator.

Devin supports ACP session/load. Its native locator is a SQLite row, not a file;
its resume policy validates native identity and session locks, and uses the native
main-chain revision for checkpoints. Legacy records without a checkpoint may
load the existing unlocked native session. Same-provider reconnect preserves the
observed model and mode and never replays the saved transcript into itself.
A failed resume must not silently create a replacement native session.
`test:desktop-continuity` covers warm preview sync, full idle shutdown, and legacy
journal recovery. `test-devin-resume.ts` checks native revisions and lock handling.

New checkpoint payloads use self-contained private Git packs, not the user's
object database. Captures must not add objects or refs to that database. Restore
imports the selected pack before publishing the saved index, so later checkpoint
expiration cannot strand staged blobs. Legacy repository-backed checkpoints remain
readable; their refs are removed only after ownership checks and a Git compare-and-swap.
Never run Git GC against a user's repository to enforce Mako's storage policy.

Retained checkpoint payloads are limited to 1 GiB per profile/workspace, with a
512 MiB per-capture limit, a 30-day/1,000-record retention target, and at most 64
removals per pass. This payload budget excludes the SQLite catalog, provider-native
history, and bounded temporary capture files. Active baselines, persisted 30-minute
preview leases, and unfinished restore inputs/backups are protected. If they fill
the budget, refuse a new retained capture rather than delete recovery data.
Rewind reuses the preview as its durable backup; current-state and compensation
captures are temporary and cleaned up, including after a process crash. Only an
unfinished capture with a dead owner may be reclaimed without a catalog row;
completed or live uncatalogued payloads remain protected and count against admission.
Completed restore receipts remain valid after their checkpoint expires.
`npm run test:workspace-snapshots` checks these rules in disposable repositories.
`npm run benchmark:snapshots` records capture/preview/restore timings and retained
bytes for 100-file and 5,000-file fixtures.

`npm run test:packaged-lifecycle -- /path/to/Mako.app --renderer-only` checks
packaged launch and draft reload without starting a provider. Provider lifecycle
checks still require valid provider authentication. Until a workspace or existing
conversation supplies a draft target, the composer is inert and read-only; otherwise
startup input is saved under `project:/` and disappears when workspace metadata arrives.
The test waits for the editable composer and verifies trusted input delivery before
reloading. `MAKO_PACKAGE_SOAK_MS=600000` runs a ten-minute reload workload. The sampler
records whole-tree RSS and per-process physical footprint, with 4 GiB stop limits
and a 10% system-memory-free floor. It checks steady-state footprint growth after
warmup. macOS's setuid-root `ps` can deny physical readings; the approved unprivileged
mode records that coverage gap explicitly, never as a successful zero-byte reading.
Other measurement failures still fail the check. The native sampler is test tooling,
compiled with the installed Command Line Tools, not an application dependency.
